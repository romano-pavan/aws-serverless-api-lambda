# aws-serverless-api-lambda
moved away from traditional server-based infrastructure (like EC2) and built a fully **Serverless** application. The goal was to deploy a Python script that executes on-demand via a public URL


##  Tech Stack Used
* **Compute:** AWS Lambda (Python 3.12)
* **Routing & Endpoint:** Amazon API Gateway (HTTP API)
* **Data Format:** JSON


##  Architecture Flow

1. **User** makes an HTTP GET request to the public endpoint URL generated by API Gateway.

2. **API Gateway** acts as the "front door", receives the request, and triggers the Lambda function.

3. **AWS Lambda** spins up a micro-container in milliseconds, executes the Python script, processes any URL parameters (Query Strings), and returns the payload.

5. **API Gateway** forwards the JSON response back to the user's browser.
